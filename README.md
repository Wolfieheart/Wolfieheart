Hey there I am Wolfst0rm and I am a Scrum Software Tester and Developer. I am very passionate about both my job and what I have developed. On my Github, you will see some of the projects that I have helped contribute to as a Tester. If you enjoy looking into the more technical side of things, or my developments, you can also find what I have been writing recently.

I mostly work with [**Java**](http://github.com/topics/java) and [**JavaScript**](http://github.com/topics/javascript). I also know [**PHP**](https://github.com/topics/php), [**Python**](https://github.com/topics/python) and [**C#**](https://github.com/topics/csharp).

----

I use [**Windows NT**](https://github.com/topics/windows) as my front-end daily driver and I use [**Linux/Debian**](https://github.com/topics/linux) as my server-side daily driver.  My first introduction to Windows came in the late 90s and my first introduction to Linux came in 2014. 

I am also a fan of running things in containers using [**Docker**](https://github.com/topics/docker).
